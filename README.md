# Pets Hotel with Scenarios

Heroku link: https://petfriendshotel.herokuapp.com

A simple management system for the pet hotel is a little hobby project :-) The project is based on the concept of "scripts": every pet visit to the hotel is associated with a "script". Each scenario consists of animal care activities (to feed, to walk, to comb, to check water level, etc.) which call â€œevents". Currently, I use the following stack for the system: Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap. I'm adding functionality to the system occasionally.
